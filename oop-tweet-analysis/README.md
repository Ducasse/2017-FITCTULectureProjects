# Tweet analysis

This project was created as semestral work for BI-OOP course on FIT CTU. Main goal is to implement certain topic using [Pharo](http://pharo.org).

My topic is to do some tweet analysis on Twitter stream. Apllication will use public Twitter API and processing tweet data. As result it will genetate graphics visualizations using [Agile](http://agilevisualization.com/) and maybe with some help by [Moose](http://moosetechnology.org/).


## Weekly reports

During this week the final topic was finalized. Rest of the time I spent on by reading about twitter api documentation and about visualization options using Pharo. Also I tried to understand pure Pharo more deeply.

This week I was playing with Twitter REST API using ZnClient in Pharo. I tried to call some request to retrieve data, dave them and diplay for simplicity and API testing. Next thing I've done was some really simple graphs using Agile quick start [page](http://agilevisualization.com/AgileVisualization/QuickStart/0101-QuickStart.html).
Finally I was thinking about some ways how to connect theese two thing and ho to start implementing main application. So for next time I will try to create simple visualization using real data from API.

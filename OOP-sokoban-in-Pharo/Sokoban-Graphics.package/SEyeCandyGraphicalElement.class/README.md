I am a Bloc Graphical Element represeting an eye candy in a Sokoban game. Eye candy is a tile, which has no gameplay meaning, but looks good to the player. In further development, eye candy can be for example a bush, painting on a wall, or a flaming fire.

This element isn't used in the game yet, but could be used in the future.

Fitoban: A Sokoban Implementation in Pharo
==========================================

What this is?
-------------
In this project we try to implement a simple Sokoban game in Pharo. This project
is developed for the BI-OOP lecture at the Faculty of Information Technology of 
Czech Technical University in Prague.

The main goals
--------------
We have set ourselves two reachable goals which should be implented by the
end of the course.

 * A game model, representing all the elements in the game. Also creating some playable levels.
 * Simple graphics (using basic Bloc tools such as shapes)
 

Other possible features
-----------------------
There are also many other possible features which may or may not be implemented 
in the future based on the time and programming difficulty of the main goals.

These other possible features include:

 * A simple menu
 * A save and load system
 * A better 2D sprite graphics (based on some free game art)
 * Animations
 * A system for creating custom maps (maybe a text representation of the maps)

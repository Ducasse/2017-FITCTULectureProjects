Game - object describing and creating game

Grid - map of level, contains tiles

GameObject - basic object capable of holding parts
	VisualObject - composed of Transform and Renderer
		MiningMachine - composed of RigidBody, Collider, Controller, OreContainer, AnimationRenderer is used instead of Renderer
		Tile - level obstacle elements
			AirTile - empty tile, not obstacle
			MineableTile - can be mined
				DirtTile - does nothing when mined
				OreTile - gives something when mined
					CoalTile - gives coal
					DiamondTile - gives diamond

				StoneTile
		
		Materials - mined object waiting to be sold, different names, prices, images...
			Coal
			Diamond
			Iron
			Silver
			Gold

Behaviour - part of object
	Transform - position and orientation

	Collider - capable of detecting collisions
		SquareCollider - has shape of square
	Renderer - capable of displaying
		SpriteRenderer - displays image
			AnimationRenderer - capable of animations

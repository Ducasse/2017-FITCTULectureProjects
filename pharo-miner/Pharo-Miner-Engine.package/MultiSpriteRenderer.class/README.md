I have the ability to draw my GameObject as image selected by rules.

I carry image that should be used in place of GameObject.
I detect if any rules are true and change image based on that.
Position to draw is calculated using Transform of my GameObject.

I need my GameObject to contain Transform behaviour to function correctly.

I represent the game grid. I store BlockHolders in the Matrix. You can access them using my accessing methods or you can ask me to perform some actions upon them.

You can create me just by typing Map random - in this case, I wil generate myself randomly. 
If you don't want a random instance, you can also create me by  #blocks: at my class side. Please make sure, you are giving me a Matrix of BlockHolders, not Blocks!

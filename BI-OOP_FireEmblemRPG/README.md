    We met all together this day, we merged and completed the project. And we implemented some final things to the project. Also we wrote documentation to the game.
    Because of huge problems with Pharo like random crashing when saving image or Iceberg pull/push problems we can't implement as much functionality as we want.
    Anyway programming in Pharo was something new for us and it was new programming experience.

29.12.2017
    We created images to each class and team. We kept working on tests for classes.
    We crated new complex battle system called PekosYs. We created event log window for champion interaction and side bar for displaying champions info.
    We added test for GameMap class. We added images to map, such as trees, ground,... We did some refactoring and some cosmetic changes.
    We implemented difference between move and attack distance. We fully implemented for character creation(creation of 8 champions - choose class, random names).
22.12.2017
    We slightly changed design of the champion creation menu. We added polymorphism to class champion where each class(Tank, Healer, ...) innherrits from parent class champion.
    We worked on deeper system of interaction between champions(damage dealing, healing, report of actions). We worked on side menu in the game. 
    We have some problems with Iceberg, so our progress was slowed a bit. We refactored names in the map classes. 

15.12.2017
    We started working on side menu panel, it will be showing stats of each champion, when clicked. Also it will be showing info about interaction between champions.
    That includes dealing damage, helaing, actual health of champions and experience increments.
    Movement distance on the map depends on champions movement stat(this is implemented recursively). We added main menu with buttons for selecting levels. 
    We have some problems with Iceberg, so our progress was slowed a bit.

8.12.2017
    We added scaleable map. We found some images for champions and for the level design. We also studied technologies for menu and character creation in Bloc.
    We added the interact method in champion class. This method implements interaction between two champions, it includes attacking a achampion or healing a champion, or no reaction. We were solving problems with Iceberg in Pharo.
    
1.12.2017
    We wrote testing class for Champion's classes (Ability, Abilities, Level). 
    We improved the map, characters are already moving, map is bigger, each block has its own axis, and background image (now only color) and something on the top of the block.
    We studied technologies and oportunities for the game menu.     

24.11.2017
    We planned the structure of our project. We assigned tasks to members of our team.
    We started work on class Champion it is commited to repository. This class includes definition of abilities, stats, levels and allow adding experience and leveling the champion.
    You can deal damage to him and revive him (restore HP to max value)
    We studied graphical interface of the game. Small map was created as example.

9.11.2017
    We spent first work week playing and studying system of game FireEmblem, which is topic of our semestral project. 
    We created gitLab repository for our project and we tested our connections from Pharo.
